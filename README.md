# Introduction

In this Software Project Lab-II, we intend to build an Open World, third-person
shooting action RPG (Role Playing Game). The game will feature a dystopian
future megacity featuring a story with vivid storytelling and complex character arcs
with lots of moral ambiguity. Along with this main quest, there will be lots of side
quests to diversify the storytelling and the gameplay. The player will also have
freedom of movement and freedom of world and NPC (Non-Playable Characters)
interaction. Different NPC interactions can affect future gameplay.

With the spirit of the Open World games, this game will also be exploration
focused. A complex economic system where the currency is replaced by the drug
which is directly linked with the life or immediate death of a person will also be
featured. So in a way, the currency dictates how long a person is going to live,
making the rich practically immortal and the poor directly at the mercy of the rich
leaving them in constant indentured servitude.

The gameplay will feature detailed 3D animation, standard 3rd person movement
mechanics like walking, running, jumping etc. Vehicle mechanics will also be
featured. Standard combat mechanics like 3rd person shooting, sniping, and melee
combat mechanics like barehanded fighting, basic knife combats etc will also be
implemented. Some stealth gameplay mechanics will also be included. The
introductory mission and a few other missions will be implemented.

# Scope

As an open-world game, it is extremely time-consuming to build the whole map
and populate it with meaningful quest lines and side activities. So we opted to
build a much smaller intro area to showcase the tutorial for most of the game
mechanics. So the main focus of our plan for the SPL is to build a limited
open-world with only a smaller part of the city but with all the core game
mechanics like standard movement mechanics, vehicle mechanics, basic combat
mechanics like third-person shooting and some limited melee combats. We also
want to work on some basic NPC AI’s (for example enemy AI).

# Motivation

The main motivation for our project came from the 2011 movie “In time” and the
2020 game “Cyberpunk 2077”. But the main inspiration for world-building is the
“Blade Runner” franchise.

# Workplan

We have created a rough map for the open-world. We will use Blender to render
the game assets and import them in Unity which we chose as our game engine. We
will do the necessary scripting as we go in C# and sometimes Objective C.
Technologies to use: Blender, Unity, C#, Objective C.
